# fcc-projects

Collection of FreeCodeCamp practice work: HTML/CSS layouts, vanilla JavaScript exercises, and React apps (mostly Vite-based). The repo is organized by topic and includes both small drills and larger certificate projects.

## Structure
- `HTML/` simple pages and form/table exercises.
- `CSS/` styling drills and layout practice.
- `JavaScript/` scripts, DOM manipulation training, and small JS apps.
- `React/` multiple React projects (accordion, tic-tac-toe, currency converter, etc.).
- `Certificate Projects/` more complete FCC certificate-style projects.
- Root-level folders like `Build a Stylized To-Do list/` and `Design a Business Card/` are standalone HTML/CSS exercises.

## How to run
Static projects:
- Open the `index.html` file for the project in a browser.

React projects:
- From the project folder that contains `package.json`:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`

## Notes
- Folder names include spaces; quote paths in the terminal if needed.
- Some projects include assets (images, PDFs) inside their folders.
