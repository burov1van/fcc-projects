# Tic Tac Toe (React + Vite)

Simple beginner project where I built a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game with React and Vite. You can play for two players on one screen, see whose turn it is, and reset the board at any time.

## What it includes

- 3x3 board with win and draw detection
- Turn indicator for X or O
- Disabled buttons for taken cells
- Reset button to start a new game

## Tech stack

- React with Vite
- `useState` hooks for game logic
- Basic CSS grid for layout and buttons

## How to run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the link from the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).

## Improvements I want to add

- Highlight the winning line
- Scoreboard for X and O
- Small click animation on each cell
