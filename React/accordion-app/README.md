# Accordion FAQ App

A simple training project built with React + Vite. It shows a FAQ accordion where items can be opened one by one or all at once, and a star-rating block placed directly under the accordion so users can rate the experience. The styling is minimal, black-and-white, and easy to scan.

## Features
- FAQ accordion: expand a single question or open/close all at once.
- Star rating: 10 stars by default with hover and click selection.
- Simple monochrome styling; accordion and rating are aligned in one column.
- Lightweight Vite setup with fast dev server and HMR.

## Tech Stack
